                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am a driven and versatile individual pursuing a Doctor of Pharmacy degree alongside a Software Engineering program at ALX. My journey in software engineering has been challenging yet rewarding, as I balance the demands of pharmacy studies with coding and tech development. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After completing the Professional Foundations program at ALS, I honed eight vital meta-skills essential for thriving in any industry. These skills have empowered me to excel in various tech domains, such as user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design, as well as software development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the Professional Foundations program, I contributed to impactful projects like:
                        EcoSmart App: Tackling waste management issues in Ghana.
                        Teachers Connect App: Providing resources for educators to overcome teaching challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’ve also gained practical experience working on freelance platforms such as Fiverr, Upwork, and Livingston Research, delivering quality solutions in tech tools, Google Space apps, AI tools, and more. I aspire to become a full-stack software engineer capable of solving global challenges with innovative technology.
